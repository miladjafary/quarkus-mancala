The general rules of the game are explained on Wikipedia(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalah) and this game is runs a game of 6-stone Kalah. 

This project has been developed on Quarkus, which is a Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework. 
If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: https://quarkus.io/ .

Besides, Mancala comes with a simple user interface which is developed by angularjs 8.0 (https://angularjs.org/) and bootstrap 4.0 (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/)

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
mvn compile quarkus:dev
```

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
mvn package
```
It produces the `mancala-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar` file in the `/target` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/mancala-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar`.

Now you can open http://localhost:8080/index.html on your browser to see the Mancala web interface.

# Mancala REST API

There are some REST api in this project to manage the game. You can find out the API specification from the
`src/main/resources/META-INF/openapi.yml`

Besides, once your application is started, you can make a request to the default `/openapi` endpoint to download the API specification
```
curl http://localhost:8080/openapi
```

## View REST API in Swagger UI
You can access to the swaggerui when the project is started in dev mode. 
```shell script
mvn compile quarkus:dev
```
Once your application is started, you can go to [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui]() and play with your API.

## Game SDK
In this project a Mancala game sdk has been developed that is responsible for preparation and rule controlling of the game. 
Since it has been developed based on a pure java, you can take advantage of it to use in any other Java framework such as Spring Boot.

The SDK can be found under the `src/main/java/com/miladjafari/mancala/sdk` package

## Javadoc
Your Javadoc can be generated by using: 
```shell script
mvn install
```
Afterward, the Javadoc will be available on `target/apidocs/index.html`

## Code Coverage 
In this project JaCoCo Maven plugin is used to generate a code coverage report. You can generate report by using:
```shell script
mvn clean test
```
The code coverage report will be generated at `target/site/jacoco/*`. Open `target/site/jacoco/index.html` file, review the code coverage report
